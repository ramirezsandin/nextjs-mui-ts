# Description

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`] to be used as a template and a starting point with all the initial tweaks to start using it with:

- Typescript
- Material UI (MUI 5)


## Additional info

It includes a custom ThemeContext that wraps the original ThemeContext from MUI, so the theme mode (light or dark) can be changed on request.
